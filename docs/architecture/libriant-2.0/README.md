# Libriant 2.0 — architecture of record

This directory holds the design Libriant is being built to. It exists here, in
the repository, for the same reason `docs/audit/` does: the reasoning behind a
decision has to be readable next to the code that implements it, years later,
by someone who was not in the room.

## What is here

| [`MASTER-ARCHITECTURE.md`](./MASTER-ARCHITECTURE.md) | The plan of record. Target architecture, the bibliographic-core decision with its DDL, the 2.0 tenant schema, nine cross-cutting contracts each with exactly one owner, the standards compliance matrix, the phased roadmap, what is deliberately not built, and the top risks. |

## How it was produced, and what that means for trusting it

Eight domain architectures were designed independently — bibliographic core,
circulation, acquisitions/serials/ERM/ILL, interoperability, the native desktop
client, search and AI, patron experience, and platform. Three adversarial
reviewers then read all eight together: one for merge coherence (contradictions,
duplication, seams with no owner), one for library-standards correctness, and
one for deliverability and sequencing. The master document is the synthesis, and
it resolves every conflict by CHOOSING — where two specs disagreed, one option
is in the document and the other is deleted rather than deferred.

That process is worth knowing about because of what the standards reviewer
caught. Several of the eight specs were confidently wrong in ways that would
have shipped:

- **MARC leader.** Three specs said to store and re-emit Leader/10, /11 and
  /20-23 verbatim. Those positions are FIXED in MARC 21 (`2`, `2`, `4500`).
  Records written that way are rejected by Koha, Alma, Voyager and
  `yaz-marcdump`. The rule is asymmetric: honour what a record declares on
  read, always emit the fixed values on write.
- **ISO 28560.** Part 2 and part 3 were described the wrong way round, and the
  RFID **AFI polarity was inverted** — `0xC2` is secured/in-library and `0x07`
  is unsecured/on-loan. Shipped as specified, the security gate would have
  alarmed on every book a patron legitimately checked out and stayed silent for
  every book that walked out unissued.
- **SIP2.** Messages 96 and 97 were described in the wrong direction. `96` is
  Request ACS Resend (self-check to server); `97` is Request SC Resend. Reversed,
  every self-check unit drops its connection.
- **COUNTER.** Release 5.1 restructured `Attribute_Performance` and removed
  `Section_Type`. A 5.0-shaped parser fed a 5.1 report finds zero metrics and
  silently produces cost-per-use figures a library puts in a budget submission.
- **KBART.** One spec cited "RP-2014-001", which does not exist. The standard is
  NISO RP-9-2014 (Phase II).
- **Bath Profile.** No spec mentioned it. A Z39.50 server that answers only the
  attribute combinations its authors imagined is unusable by OCLC Connexion,
  Koha and VuFind — and unverifiable in a public tender.

Every one of those corrections is carried in the master document. They are the
argument for why it is worth reading before writing code in this area, and the
reason the standards matrix cites version numbers rather than bare names.

## What this document is not

It is not a specification anyone has agreed to implement verbatim, and it is not
a substitute for reading the code. Where the two disagree, **the code is what
runs** — but a divergence is a fact worth recording here rather than leaving for
the next person to rediscover. Phases amend it as they land.

## Divergences recorded as phases land

**Phase 5 — metrics registry + queue consolidation.** Two sub-items of the
master document's phase-5 line describe a repository that does not exist yet,
and were deliberately not implemented:

- _"the merged **six-queue** list wired into worker.ts"_ — the six queues named
  in §1 (`notices`, `catalog`, `search`, `report`, `acquisitions`, `webhook`)
  arrive with the milestones that produce them; the notices queue is phase 22.
  What exists today is five (`email-outbox`, `scheduled`, `import`,
  `maintenance`, `export`), and registering six consumers for queues nothing
  produces would pin `/readyz` at 503 permanently, because readiness is now
  strictly "every registered consumer is running". The consolidation — one list,
  four surfaces derived from it — is what phase 5 owed and shipped;
  `apps/api/src/queues/consumers.ts` is where the sixth is added.
- _"`EMITTERS` widened to `apps/protocol-gateway/src` and a Rust declaration
  file"_ — neither exists (`ls apps` is api, desktop, site, web; there is no
  `Cargo.toml` in the repository). Adding those roots would read as coverage and
  cover nothing, which is the failure mode `check:alerts` exists to prevent.
  `SOURCES` in `scripts/check-alerts.ts` is the one place to widen when the
  gateway lands, and a declaration whose `source` has no entry there fails the
  build.

Phase 5 also shipped more than the line asked for, because the both-directions
check found it: five alert rules for metrics that were emitted and unalerted, a
`libriant-web` scrape job for two gauges that had been rendered and collected by
nobody since the app was first deployed, and the wiring for
`renderScheduledJobMetrics` — exported, unit-tested and documented as being
called by `worker.ts`, which never called it.

**Phase 6 — the port boundary + public-API registry skeleton.** The master
document's line is delivered as written: `DataPort` / `PlatformPort` /
`PrintPort` in `@libriant/shared/ports`, `HttpDataPort` and its two siblings in
`apps/web/lib/ports/`, `apps/api/src/public-api/registry.ts` with
`defineEndpoint`, the `class-validator` → JSON Schema deriver, and `check:openapi`
as the sixteenth gate against an empty registry. Four things are worth recording.

- **The ESLint rule is wider than "no `fetch(` in a screen", and ships with no
  exemptions.** It also refuses a hard-coded `/lbr-api` literal, `window.open`,
  `navigator.clipboard`, `navigator.onLine` and the browser online/offline
  events, because those are the same defect — a screen naming a host it will not
  have on the Tauri client. Seventeen call sites were converted in the same
  commit so the rule turns on at `error` with zero `eslint-disable` comments; a
  rule that needs exemptions on day one is a rule nobody believes. This is NOT
  the "extract the 1.0 screens" work the master document declines: every
  conversion is a one-line substitution in a screen that phase 20 replaces.
  Route handlers under `apps/web/app/api/` are excluded — they are servers that
  happen to live under `app/`.
- **`DataPort.upload` does not take a `FormData`.** `FormData` is an HTTP
  encoding; a native host writing to a local replica has a filename and bytes.
  It takes `{ file: { name, type, data }, fields? }` and `HttpDataPort` builds
  the multipart body. Note that `packages/shared`'s tsconfig does NOT enforce
  this — `@types/node` declares `FormData` globally, so `tsc` accepts the DOM
  type there. It is a rule the reviewer keeps.
- **The deriver cannot resolve `@ValidateNested` on its own**, so contract 4.9's
  "JSON Schema derives from `class-validator`'s own `getMetadataStorage()`" is
  true with one exception. The nested class comes from `@Type(() => X)`, which is
  class-transformer metadata reachable only through the unexported deep path
  `class-transformer/cjs/storage`. Rather than reach into a package's private
  build, the deriver requires the class to be named at the endpoint and throws
  without it. It throws on an unmapped validator for the same reason: a
  published contract that understates what the server enforces is the failure
  the gate exists to prevent.
- **`check:openapi` must run as `tsx --tsconfig apps/api/tsconfig.json`**, with
  `import 'reflect-metadata'` first. There is no `tsconfig.json` at the
  repository root, so a plain `tsx` transpiles the DTOs with TC39 standard
  decorators and they throw at class-definition time with `TypeError: Cannot
read properties of undefined (reading 'constructor')` inside class-validator
  — which reads like a library bug and is a transpiler-configuration bug. This
  is the first gate that imports decorated classes; `check:permissions` and
  `check:alerts` import plain modules and never hit it. The gate asserts both
  conditions rather than trusting them, and declares no decorated classes of its
  own, because `tsx` applies that tsconfig only to files its `include` covers.

With no public endpoints until M6, the document comparison alone would be nearly
vacuous — the phase-5 lesson. So the gate also proves the derived schema AGREES
with `validateDto()` on fixture DTOs: every property the schema calls required
is genuinely rejected when omitted, every optional one genuinely accepted, and
an unknown key genuinely refused, which is what licenses
`additionalProperties: false`. That check found two real defects in the deriver
before it shipped — `@ValidateIf` being read as `@IsOptional` (both record
`conditionalValidation`; only the latter carries `name: 'isOptional'`), and a
truthiness test that made `@Equals(false)` throw.
